## List of Experiments

1. [Use Eclipse or NetBeans platform and acquaint yourself with the various menus. Create a test project, add a test class, and run it. See how you can use auto-suggestions, auto-fill. Try code formatter and code refactoring like renaming variables, methods, and classes. Try debug step by step with a small program of about 10 to 15 lines which contains at least one if-else condition and a for loop.](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/blob/main/PrimeNumberChecker.java)

2. [Write a Java program to demonstrate the OOP principles. [i.e., Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction]](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/tree/main/OOP%20principles)

3. [Write a Java program to handle checked and unchecked exceptions. Also, demonstrate the usage of custom exceptions in real-time scenarios.](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/tree/main/ExceptionHandling)

4. [Write a Java program on Random Access File class to perform different read and write operations.](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/blob/main/RandomIO.java)

5. [Write a Java program to demonstrate the working of different collection classes. [Use package structure to store multiple classes].](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/tree/main/Collections)

6. [Write a program to synchronize the threads acting on the same object. [Consider the example of any reservations like railway, bus, movie ticket booking, etc.]](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/blob/main/ThreadsProg.java)

7. [Write a program to perform CRUD operations on the student table in a database using JDBC.](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/tree/main/DatabaseOperations)

8. [Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for the digits and for the +, -, *, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divided by zero.](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/tree/main/Calc)

9. [Write a Java program that handles all mouse events and shows the event name at the center of the window when a mouse event is fired. [Use Adapter classes]](https://github.com/helloworld9948/JAVA/blob/main/MouseEvents.java)
